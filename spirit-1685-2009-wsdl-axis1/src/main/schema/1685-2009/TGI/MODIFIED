
This is a marker file to highlight the following modifications have been made to the
original XSD files in order to generate interoperability WSDL client stubs.

The LICENSE the XSD/WSDL/HTML/XML files are utilized under prohibits any modification
of the files when redistributed.  So this separate file exists to document the nature
of the modification required for AXIS1 processing.


TGI/TGI.wsdl:50:
        <xsd:union memberTypes="xsd:string"/>
this line was replaced with:
        <!-- XSD change by dlmiles, AXIS1 generation error on the original -->
        <!-- This is not really xsd:union unless you have multiple memberTypes specified ? -->
        <xsd:restriction base="xsd:string"/>
        <!-- <xsd:union memberTypes="xsd:string"/> -->


This change was carried by via an XSLT using transform-wsdl.xsl.
